abstract="With the increasing popularity of android devices and the adoption of android-based operating systems for personal devices, the frequency of malware attacks has also increased. Android malware has become one of the leading threats to the omnipresent and valuable Android ecosystem. Various solutions leveraging dynamic and static properties and machine learning capabilities to detect android malware are being invariably developed and are at an arms race with malware authors in this seemingly never-ending war. Nature-inspired strategies have delivered us sophisticated solutions across a broad spectrum of challenges, and works within computer systems and optimisation are uniformly filled with cases in which algorithms and/or strategies either accommodated from or inspired from one or more phenomena in nature, varying from efficient packet routing, anomaly detection to IDS optimisation, and more.",
