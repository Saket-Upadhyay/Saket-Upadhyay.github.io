<div class="message">(Efficient and resource saving trick that was there for decades)</div>

<p>During password cracking you might decide to brute force a target hash,any service or online website, for that you may need/create heavy dictionaries which can take terabytes of data. But we can skip that step and feed the password directly from generator to brute-force automation software.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-an-eight-digit-long-numeric-password-take-on-disk">How much an eight digit long numeric password take on disk?</h3>

<p>Let’s have a look on most basic and may-be-doesn’t-even-happen-today kind of scenario, creating a 8 digit numerical password with crunch.</p>

858 MB for 8 digit numeric? not too big right, with our 1–2TBs of hard-drives it will do no harm to us.</p>

<p>let’s come to real-life condition now, step-by-step …</p>

<p>8 letter lowercase alphabets ? …

1 TB ! just for our new word-list, and to be honest I am writing this from my PC with total storage of 1TB … if i remove all the files and OSes then i may store it, but again i need OS to perform attacks ¯_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

<p>and this is last one fulfilling all the basic NEEDS OF MODERN WEBSITES.</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least one UPPERCASE</li>
  <li>use of NUMBERS</li>
  <li>lowecase</li>
  <li>SPECIAL SYMBOLS</li>
  <li>Alien species’s language and what ever your PC allows you to throw at login filed!</li>
</ul>

<p>CHAR-SET =</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!”#$%&amp;’()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[]^_`{|}~

now unless you own a data storage farm to store 54303 TB of data, that would be ~ 27150 common 2TB storage drives, so let’s get over this problem by ‘piping’ the output directly to software rather than storing it in the device itself.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-overcome-this-limitation">How to overcome this limitation?</h3>

<p>Suppose we want to crack the hash of password <strong>‘17652986’</strong> now md5 of this hash <strong>ce5cff0195a6b059a3241c1b6202ab49</strong> now we can either create a file of 8 digits numbers or can just pass the list from crunch directly to hashcat</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>crunch 8 8 123456789| hashcat <span class="nt">-m</span> 0 ce5cff0195a6b059a32411b6202ab49
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>notice the <strong>‘|’</strong> in the command? this is called <strong>‘pipe’</strong> it will change the standard output of the crunch command to to hashcat and the hashcat when supplied no word-lists, listens on standard input.

<p>Flow of data from buffer to brute-force program directly (left figure) — (1)</p>

<p>Flow of data to hard-disk and then to the program (right figure) — (2)</p>

<p>Here we can already see (1) is much faster and efficient in practice as it does not interact with the hard-disk at all.</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*SUUvuNKweFdpjLSMVaabcg.png" alt="" />
and you can see it took just 31 seconds to crack 8 digit numeric password <em>highlighted</em>, but that’s predictable and speed here was not our concern.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>So, our motive here is complete as we have saved resources and hacking with all the skills is also all about speed, accuracy and efficiency.</p>
