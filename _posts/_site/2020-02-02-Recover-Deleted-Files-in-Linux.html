Recover recently deleted file (if it’s still open in some process) using properties of procfs
</div>

<!--more-->

<p>Ever deleted an important file while it’s still open in some other process?
or Someone opened a PDF file in your PC from pen drive and removed the pen drive while it’s still open in some PDF-Viewer and you wanted to save it first and now you are just not touching that process because that’s the last trace of that file left in your computer?</p>

<p>Well, luckily you have <strong>procfs</strong> to your rescue. Let’s check the definition :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>/proc</strong> is very special in that it is also a virtual filesystem. It’s sometimes referred to as a process information pseudo-file system. It doesn’t contain ‘real’ files but runtime system information (e.g. system memory, devices mounted, hardware configuration, etc). For this reason it can be regarded as a control and information centre for the kernel. In fact, quite a lot of system utilities are simply calls to files in this directory. For example, <strong>‘lsmod’</strong> is the same as ‘<strong>cat /proc/modules’</strong> while <strong><em>‘lspci’ is a synonym for ‘cat /proc/pci’</em></strong>. By altering files located in this directory you can even read/change kernel parameters (sysctl) while the system is running.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup.</h3>

<p>For this demonstration we just need one pdf file and… well that’s it!</p>

<p><em>[I am using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for this demo.]</em></p>

<h3 id="how-to">How to.</h3>

<p>Let’s follow this step-by-step.</p>

<h4 id="step-0">STEP 0:</h4>

<p>Open the PDF file with default PDF viewer.</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ZbJE03T5B3HXw4yuf_cnMQ.png" alt="" title="PDF document open in a PDF viewer (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)" /></p>

<h4 id="step-1">STEP 1:</h4>

<p>DELETE THE FILE. FROM THE FOLDER. P E R M A N E N T L Y.</p>

<h4 id="step-2">STEP 2:</h4>

<p>Now as we have deleted the file, let’s get on work to recover that.</p>

<p>Let’s fetch our PDF viewer’s PID (Process ID) using “ps”</p>

<p>What’s pid you might ask? here…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the process identifier (a.k.a. process ID or PID) is a number used by most operating system kernels — such as those of Unix, macOS and Windows — to uniquely identify an active process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*iCZcVmfFRLe2poxYp8vHzg.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>so now we have our PID = <strong>5201.</strong></p>

<h4 id="step-3">STEP 3:</h4>

<p>Let’s go to /proc/<strong>&lt;pid&gt;</strong>,yes that’s how your Linux PC keeps track of processes.</p>

<p>In our case it’s <strong><em>/proc/5201/</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*oiitajakNYIaKFXmPYlD6Q.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="step-4">STEP 4:</h4>

<p>We will now try to locate the file descriptor for our target file in the process, file descriptor? here you go…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <strong>file descriptor</strong> is a number that uniquely identifies an open file in a computer’s operating system. It describes a data resource, and how that resource may be accessed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, go to “fd” (file descriptor) folder.</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*YzcnPHuUv8vMMJs_wlcBZw.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We can see that <strong>file descriptor 14</strong> points to our ex-impotant-ish file DocumentPDF.pdf and smartly shows “(deleted)” status after it.</p>

<p>But our program still has access to the PDF file and it’s open there, so how? ‘cause file descriptor points to the file’s actual real-time location from which the program is using it,so if not on disk then in memory.</p>

<h4 id="step-5">STEP 5:</h4>

<p>Just “cat” the file pointer to some other location, and that’s it!</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*BKXfsQkGCjjCiQmJgN9qog.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we write the file bit-wise to <strong>“restore.pdf”</strong> using ‘cat’.</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*c9Ht4a7Lm8CQavq7l-6sOQ.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>AND BAM !!! We have our file back.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is one of the things I found interesting enough while reading about Linux file system and mysteries of it’s file and process management techniques, which was worth sharing.</p>
