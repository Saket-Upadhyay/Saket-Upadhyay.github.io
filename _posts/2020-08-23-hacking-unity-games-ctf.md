Exploring Unity Game Security

A writeup of Misc. Challange of PhantomCTF Unity Game Hack Challenge
Points : 650
</div>

### Background
As a part of #FrigidSec I participated in PhantomCTF where they made a very simple Unity Based Game for us to crack.

It looks like Angrybirds inspired, we need to kill the stacked up enimies to win the game and get the flag.

But here's the catch : Hiting the Pigs will not decrease the `Health Value` as we need to somehow hack that.


### Unity Binary Basics

#### Official Docs


#### Dependency Structure


### Analysing Visual C++ Libraries


### Getting flag of this challenge


### What we learn from this and baseline for future posts.

In future posts I plan to Explore more about this dependency and structure and how we can exploit this in different ways.

And also the ways to avoid this and try to create more robust games.

### Invitation for Colaboration

I am no GameDeveloper
