<div class="message">
I am starting a new type of posts, making some changes, etc. I want to talk about it.

## Updating `AboutMe` section.

I wanted to do this for a long time, but doing it now, from 2021 eve to Jan, there will be a significant modification to this website. I will remove some sections and will add some new ones as per need.
My main intention or idea for this small Blog is to make it more casual but not a joke. You see, there is a thin line between too much casual (which usually ends up being a joke) and too much formal (which is boring).

My current AboutMe is more suitable for 1st year CTF-junkie undergrad xD. But, as now I am in the last year of my B.Tech., this is not a good composition for this segment. So, I want to make it more subtle and clean, make it look more PRO-ish.

Anyways, so there's that.

## Random Thoughts

I come across loads of ideas over time, and I want to write them down or share them. But eventually, after some time (an hour or a day later) I  usually forget what I was thinking about earlier.

The downside of this process is that I lose a good potential project or small research idea just like that. If only there were a place where I can share the things, maybe I will use that idea later, or someone else will read it, and maybe we can do something together on it (that would be fun thoa).

Anyway, so that's the reason I want to do this. 
Okay, so these kinds of posts will follow the following appellation: `"RT Y: XXXXXX"`, where `'XXXXXXX'` being the topic and `'Y'` is a number, concerning the post sequence from `0` to `N`.


## Off-Topic

These will be posts that might not be too much relevant to `Security` or my research topic, these are general experiences ... or you can say ... some events/incidents/things/findings that I want to share with the Internet.

The main reason for this is, I don't want this website to be just another exhibition of my work or achievements, we have LinkedIn, Twitter, and ResearchGate profiles for that. I want it to be more like a reflection of general thoughts and a place to get in sync with my thought process and me as a person (formally / casually, academically, or otherwise). 

So these kind of posts will follow the following nomenclature : `"OT Y : XXXXXXX"` where `Y ∈ {0,1,2,...,N}` and `X ∈ {((A-Z)*+(a-z)*+(0-9)*)*}`


## Main Index Page at the top or in the sidebar

And there is a good possibility that the main articles will be lost somewhere in between all this, so I will add one Index page to keep track of everything in one place. And also highlight popular/important articles etc.


Well, that's all for this post. Just wanted to share this new addition. Have a nice day (^\_^)
