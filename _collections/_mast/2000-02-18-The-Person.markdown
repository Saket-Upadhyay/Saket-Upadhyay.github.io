Saket is a passionate computer science research student with experience in academic and industrial cybersecurity research. He holds two patents and four copyrights for his work on Nature-Inspired Cyber Security. His work has been published in high-impact research publications. He is very enthusiastic about teaching and research and plans to join academia as a lecturer after his doctorate from the University of Virginia, USA. His current research interest lies in Low-level software security, Hardware Security, Malware Analysis, Threat Intelligence, and Nature Inspired approach.

His work on Android Malware analysis and threat intelligence titled "PACE: Platform for Android Malware Classification and Performance Evaluation" was awarded the "Best Paper Award" at The 3rd International Workshop on Big Data Analytic for Cyber Crime Investigation and Prevention, IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2019, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

 
Since the start of my undergrad, I've been particularly curious about low-level security, assembly language, reverse engineering, and hardware security. Even though I was not able to put my hands on some of these topics then, I plan to explore them during my first year of Ph.D.; UVa has the people and resources to make it happen.
Some of the topics that I want to explore more profoundly are (not limited to)-
1. Low-Level software security.
2. Sub Ring-0 Security and Privilege Escalation.
3. Malware Detection and Analysis.
4. Processor security.
5. Low-energy computing hardware security.

If you are also working with/interested in these topics, please feel free to initiate a discussion with me!
Also, if you have any project/research around the aforementioned topics and you think I will be of any help, hit me up at-
