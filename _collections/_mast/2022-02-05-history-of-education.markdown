I am a researcher and an academician, worked in the security industry for a while, and did some projects with the government, but still, I am a student first.

I completed my Higher Secondary School (12th Grade) from <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendriya_Vidyalaya_Sangathan">Kendriya Vidyalaya</a>, Nashik, Maharashtra, India; in 2018 and then started my Undergraduate college in the same year.

I did my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) with a specialization in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics from <a class="link" href="https://vitbhopal.ac.in/">Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) University</a>, India [Bhopal Campus]. Here I got familiarized with academic and industrial research by my amazing profs. 
I completed my Undergrad in 2022 and started my Graduate school in the same year.

I got selected into the Computer Science Ph.D. program at the <a class="link" href="https://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a>, Charlottesville, VA, US; in February 2022, and will be starting my 1st year as a research student in August 2022. 


My area of curiosity is cybersecurity, specifically, low-level security, malware reverse engineering, and analysis, hardware security, and nature-inspired approach.

During my undergraduate at VIT University, I worked on and studied "Nature-Inspired Cyber Security (NICS)" with Dr. Shishir Kumar Shandilya as my guide, and "android malware detection" with Dr. Ajit Kumar. In the span of 4 years of my B.Tech. I've published two research papers on "Android Malware detection" and "NICS" each, and one book chapter titled "Nature-Inspired Malware and Anomaly Detection in Android-Based Systems" via reputed conference (IEEE International Conference on Big Data '19), journals (MDPI Future Internet, Future Generation Computer Systems [IF 7.18]) and publishers (Springer).

Since the start of my undergrad, I've been particularly curious about low-level security, assembly language, reverse engineering, and hardware security. Even though I was not able to put my hands on some of these topics then, I plan to explore them during my first year of Ph.D.; UVa has the people and resources to make it happen.
Some of the topics that I want to explore more profoundly are (not limited to)-
1. Low-Level software security.
2. Sub Ring-0 Security and Privilege Escalation.
3. Malware Detection and Analysis.
4. Processor security.
5. Low-energy computing hardware security.

If you are also working with/interested in these topics, please feel free to initiate a discussion with me!
Also, if you have any project/research around the aforementioned topics and you think I will be of any help, hit me up!
