*"Nothing in science has any value to society if it is not properly communicated." ~Saket U.*

Following is the list of documents/links containing records of the recent developments and efforts of the author to contribute to the global scientific community and his industrial and academic work experience-


I try my best to contribute and "give back" to the awesome global community of researchers and students by enganing in seminars, conferences, open-source development,<!--more--> talks, lectures, writing articles on <a class="link" href="https://saket-upadhyay.github.io">my Blog</a> and <a class="link" href="https://saketupadhyay.medium.com/">Medium</a>, making videos etc.

I usually open-source all my personal and academic (if allowed) projects on <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Saket-Upadhyay/">GitHub</a>. This helps me to keep a good record of my work plus it also helps in sharing my work with a wider audience.  Over the time I've received multiple emails from people who wanted to use my approach in their work or just talk about it, and I love all of those discussions, this helps me to see at drawbacks of my method which I might've overlooked at the time of deployment.


I would consider myself an active participant in cybersecurity conferences and global/local competitions and love the "creative and engaging vibe" of gatherings. I respect the curiosity of like-minded people in the field and these events often leave me with something new to learn or appreciate about computers and their working.

I am pretty active on <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saketupadhyay">LinkedIn</a> and try to keep my profile updated, it has proved to be a great platform for me to connect with people in my domain and extend my circle. It is a great tool for global networking if used correctly.

But in the end, I am a researcher and share my findings in scientific community through academic publications in reputed journals and conferences. I have accounts on <a class="link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bT9RE28AAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>, <a class="link" href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0574-7843">ORCID</a> (0000-0003-0574-7843) and <a class="link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saket-Upadhyay-3">Research Gate</a> where all of my publications are listed and updated frequently.
