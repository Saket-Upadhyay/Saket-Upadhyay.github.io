Hi! I am **Saket**.
<br>
(native : साकेत)
<br>
<br>
I am interested in exploring the field of advance `adaptive cyber defense` systems. 
Currently an undergraduate student, Researcher wannabe.

If you are *interested* in my field of work or want to *collaborate* in any project or research, please check out my more serious and formal -- LinkedIn profile, and feel free to connect via Linked-IN, Twitter, or Email [ProtonMail](mailto:saketupadhyay@protonmail.com?subject=Hey%20Saket!) / [G Mail]( mailto:saketupadhya@gmail.com?subject=Hey%20Saket! ). (GitHub also works but that would be kinda weird xD).

<br>

Keywords: Nature Inspired Cyber Security (NICS), Adaptive Cyber Defense, Malware and Anomaly Detection, Android Security.
